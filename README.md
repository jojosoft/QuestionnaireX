QuestionnaireX

This application is a generic questionnaire system based on Windows Forms. You can easily create new types of questions as a Windows Form yourself. It runs on every system with Microsoft Windows and .NET Framework installed. The project relies on the FileHelpers package from NuGet, which is not contained in this repository and can be restored in Visual Studio by selecting "Tools"->"NuGet Package Manager"->"Package Manager Console" and then clicking on "Restore".
